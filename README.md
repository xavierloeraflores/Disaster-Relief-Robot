# Disaster-Relief-Robot

This is a presented solution for the WGU's Disaster Relief Problem using AI and Coppelia Robotics' virtual robot environment. This was made for a school project for WGU. I have also included a write up of the project in the `writeup.md` file. The assignment can be found in the `assignment.md` file. There will also be PDF versions of all the work submitted for the assignment.
