C951 Introduction to Artificial Intelligence

## Distaster Recovery Environment & Obstacles

## Robot Adaptability to Obstacles

## Justifications for Robot Architecture Modifications

## Maintenance Internal Environment Representation

## Reasoning, Knowledge Representation, Uncertainty, Intelligence

## Further Prototype Improvements

There are many improvements that can made to the robot to support its disaster relief endeavors. The main issue with the robot is that it has no way to access space completely blocked off by obstacles.
The following are potential improvements that can be made to the robot to mitigate this issue:

- Flight: The robot can be equipped with a flight mechanism that allows it to fly over obstacles. This would allow the robot to access areas that are completely blocked off by obstacles.
- Mechanical Arms: The robot can be equipped with mechanical arms that allow it to move obstacles out of the way. This would allow the robot to access areas that are partially blocked off by obstacles.
- Drill: The robot can be equipped with a drill that allows it to drill through obstacles. This would allow the robot to access areas that are partially blocked off by obstacles.
