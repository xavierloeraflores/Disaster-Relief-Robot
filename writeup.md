C951 Introduction to Artificial Intelligence

## Disaster Recovery Environment & Obstacles

The robot will navigate a disaster environment that is representative of a burning building with two key obstacles in the way of the robot. Fire will be scattered and present throughout the simulation in small patches that can be navigated around. There are also large pieces of debris that block large portions of the environment. The robot will need to navigate around the fire and debris to find its objectives.

## Further Prototype Improvements

There are many improvements that can made to the robot to support its disaster relief endeavors. The main issue with the robot is that it has no way to access space completely blocked off by obstacles.
The following are potential physical improvements that can be made to the robot to mitigate this issue:

- Flight: The robot can be equipped with a flight mechanism that allows it to fly over obstacles. This would allow the robot to access areas that are completely blocked off by obstacles.
- Mechanical Arms: The robot can be equipped with mechanical arms that allow it to move obstacles out of the way. This would allow the robot to access areas that are partially blocked off by obstacles.
- Drill: The robot can be equipped with a drill that allows it to drill through obstacles. This would allow the robot to access areas that are partially blocked off by obstacles.

Alternatively, the robot can improve it's performance and learning through the use of reinforced learning and advanced search algorithms.

- Reinforced Learning: The robot can be equipped with reinforced learning to improve its performance. Reinforced learning would allow the robot to learn from its mistakes and improve its performance over time if we reward/penalize the robot on its effectiveness for searching a space. This would allow the robot to learn how to navigate environments more efficiently and find more survivors in a shorter amount of time.

- Advanced Search Algorithms: The robot can be equipped with advanced search algorithms such as a depth first search or greedy algorithm to cover more ground and find more survivors. This would allow the robot to find more survivors in a shorter amount of time since the robot won't be randomly searching the environment and retreading the same ground.
